Jesus was not born into a rich family, he was not highly educated, he did not found a school, he did not write a book, he did not
lead an army, he did not conquer empires and he never even travelled more than 300 miles from his home. Yet He is unarguably 
the most influential person in the history of all mankind.
<br/><br/>
  
The gospel is that God out of His undescribable love for us became a man and took the punishment for our sins on Himself, 
dying in our stead on the cross, only to victoriously trample death by death and rise again from the dead, 
all to reunite us to Himself, to save us from certain eternal torment, to give us hope, peace, joy and everlasting life,
to restore in us what was lost when sin entered the world - the likeness of His image... 
if we only choose to turn away from our sins to Him. And He will come again to judge the living and the dead.
<br/><br/>

Would you prayerfully consider partnering with me monthly in prayer and financially to bring the power of the gospel to the world, 
to empower the churches to bring the power of the gospel to their neighbourhoods, 
and to bring the power of of the gospel into the personal prayerlife of believers?
Thank you! May God bless you and your loved ones!
