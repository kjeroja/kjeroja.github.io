    <p>I currently have the privilege of being trained to preach the gospel at Christ for all Nations Evangelism Bootcamp.
    It is a spiritually, mentally, physically rigorous, practical training by the worlds best at what they do.
    Christ for all Nations was founded by probably our times greatest evangelist Reinhard Bonnke, 
    and has since 1987 seen more than 84 million documented decisions for Christ around the world, mainly in Africa.
    <br>  
    As a part of the Evangelism Bootcamp, Christ for all Nations will take us on a mission trip to West Africa,
    where based on previous experience we will, God willing, see around 1 million documented decisions for Christ.
    Here at the Evangelism Bootcamp we have already, the 120 of us, seen alltogether more than 800 people decide to follow Jesus.
    Many have been healed of various diseases, some have been set free from evil spirits, numerous homeless, drugaddicts have been sendt to
    christian rehabilitation, two people have come to our meetings in a wheelchair and left pushing their wheelchair. People who were set on taking their own life
    were intercepted and came to church. God is doing wonderful things. We are seeing wonderful mindblowing things every week. 
    <br>
    As a graduates of the Evangelism Bootcamp we will be thorougly equipped to see people decide to follow Jesus wherever we go.
    One of the benefits of being a Bootcamp Graduate is the ability to conduct Firecamps. These are evangelism trainings that usually last around 9 days.
    I myself went through the Firecamp Norway 2022, where we saw 45 people give their lives to Jesus and multiple people healed.
    The hotel where the firecamp was held was so impacted by us, that even two months later the main talking subject for the hotel staff was the firecamp.
    One of the hotel workers was so inspired as he partook in some of the classes as a gues, that he has since led 200 people to Christ in Oslo and chose to
    partake in the next firecamp in Finland.
    The Estonian firecamp graduates instantly made a gospel outreach in Tallinn and saw 20 people give their life to Jesus.
